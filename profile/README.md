# Welcome to Trails Through Shadows 🙌

## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

This is **TTS**, our favourite pasttime and self-destructive hobby. And also our bachelor thesis project, but that's secondary. 

**Trails Through Shadows** is (or one day will be) a narrative tabletop game with hybrid parts - you need both our game and your phone/laptop/projector. It's heavily inspired by Gloomhaven and Forgotten Waters, which can be seen in the combat system and branching paths based on the player's choices in the narrative. 

## 👀 Contribution guidelines

This project is divided into repositories, respective of their parts in the system. Most of them try to use the master/development branch standard. Well, the big ones do. Then there's the Thesis and Docs repo, where it's more random. We try to use issues and feature branches to the best of our abilities.

## 👩‍💻 Useful resources

Sadly, a lot of information on the project is scattered in random Google Docs or in Discord threads. We have a documentation though, it is written in **Docs** repo, which can be seen on [this website](https://docs.tts-game.fun/). The **Thesis** repo has our actual essays, where you will (hopefully someday) be able to read about our work in detail.

## 🍪 Fun facts

- The title is completely random and doesn't hide any meaning whatsoever.
- We have no ties with any communist party or any political ideology for that matter. Any information that says otherwise is purely speculative.
